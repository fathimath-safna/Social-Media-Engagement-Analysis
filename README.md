**Social Media Engagement Analysis**
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project analyzes social media engagement patterns across platforms such as Facebook and Instagram using real-world post-level data.
It combines Python, R, and Tableau to deliver insights into how post type, timing, platform, and audience demographics affect Likes, Shares, Comments, Impressions, and Engagement Rate.
The goal is to help brands and marketers optimize their digital strategies for maximum reach and interaction.

ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives**
Identify factors influencing engagement rates.
Compare performance across social media platforms.
Determine optimal posting times and content types.
Understand audience behavior by gender, age, and region.
Build an interactive dashboard for easy insight access.

ðŸ“‚ **About the Dataset**

Source: Kaggle â€“ Social Media Engagement Report Dataset

Sentiment â€“ Post sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
Purpose: To analyze platform-specific engagement trends and determine the factors influencing interaction levels.

ðŸ›  **Tools & Technologies**
Python: Data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
R Programming: Statistical hypothesis testing (t.test, aov, chisq.test, Z-test, F-test)
Tableau: Interactive dashboards and KPI visualization

ðŸ“Š **Key Findings**
Instagram has a significantly higher engagement rate than Facebook.
Image and video posts outperform other content types.
Afternoon posts drive the highest engagement levels.
The 25â€“34 age group engages the most, followed by 18â€“24.
Positive sentiment posts consistently get more interaction.

KPI cards for total likes, comments, shares, and average engagement rate.
Filters by platform, year, gender, post type, and region
Trend analysis for monthly and weekly engagement patterns.
Demographic breakdown by age, gender, and location.
Sentiment-based engagement comparison.


I can also add dataset statistics (row count, number of platforms, unique post types) from your CSV so the README feels even richer.
Do you want me to compute and include those?
